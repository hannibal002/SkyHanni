There are websites that will claim SkyHanni is a rat.

Those websites are wrong.

Those websites might claim to know the mod has malicious code.

Looking closer at the parts in the code they claim are malicious, we notice that their detection algorithms has a lot of flaws:

Those websites might even claim their findings are powered by artifical intelligence. this is obviously wrong.

Please don't trust websites that claim to know whether or not any mod can rat you or harm your computer.

Or you use mod lists like those:
