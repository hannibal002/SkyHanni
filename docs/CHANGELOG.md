      into the clipboard. The clipboard context can be used to update the repo content.

### Removed Features

+ Removed 100 Farming Fortune from "Show As Drop Multiplier" from all displays (also known as "base ff"). - hannibal2
    + This can cause some numbers to show 100 FF too much. Simply update the values to fix it.
    + Those "base FF" values were never really part of your farming fortune stats. They are just a result of looking at
      the crop drop formula. SkyHanni used those values to be more comparable with other Discord Bots and spreadsheets.
      This also caused confusion, so we have removed it entirely now.
