### Technical Details

+ Updated to a newer version of MoulConfig. - nea & walker
    + This includes support for the new sub category part in the config.
+ Added TimeUtils.getDuration and deprecated TimeUtils.getMillis. - hannibal2
+ Created PetAPI and deprecated String.matchRegex(). - hannibal2
+ Extracted sacks, friends, known features and Jacob contests in to their separate files. - CalMWolfs
+ Add log clearing. - CalMWolfs
+ Add auto-prefix to chat message methods. - walker
+ Added support for extra data in error manager. - hannibal2
+ Added /shreadcropmilestonefromclipboard. - hannibal2
    + This command reads the clipboard content, in the format of users sending crop milestone step data.
    + The new data gets compared to the currently saved data, differences are getting replaced and the result gets put
      into the clipboard. The clipboard context can be used to update the repo content.

### Removed Features

+ Removed 100 Farming Fortune from "Show As Drop Multiplier" from all displays (also known as "base ff"). - hannibal2
    + This can cause some numbers to show 100 FF too much. Simply update the values to fix it.
    + Those "base FF" values were never really part of your farming fortune stats. They are just a result of looking at
      the crop drop formula. SkyHanni used those values to be more comparable with other Discord Bots and spreadsheets.
      This also caused confusion, so we have removed it entirely now.
