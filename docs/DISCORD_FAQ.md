_Frequently Asked Questions_

> **1: How do I open the SkyHanni Menu?**
> Use the command `/sh`.

> **2: Why does SkyHanni tell me to update NotEnoughUpdates (NEU) even if I already have the latest version?**
> To make the mod work, you need to use the latest version from <#1123201092193366027>.

> **3: How can I resize the GUI?**
> Do `/sh gui` to open the position editor. Then hover over an element and scroll your mouse wheel to change the size of a single GUI element.
> Do `/sh scale` to change the global GUI scale of all elements at once.

> **4: My Garden Crop Milestones are not accurate. What should I do?**
> To sync your Crop Milestones with SkyHanni, open `/cropmilestones` once.

> **5: How can I move GUIs like Coins/Copper in SkyMart?**
> Use the command `/sh open hotkey` to set a hotkey, and press it inside the GUI you want to move.

> **6: Will SkyHanni support Minecraft versions 1.20? (Foraging Update)**
> The Foraging update isn't expected to release for several months.
> Thus, we'll wait for other mods in the community to update for Minecraft version 1.20.
> Switching from 1.8.9 to 1.20 will take some time, and we plan to discontinue support for 1.8.9 afterward since we won't support multiple versions at once.

> **7: My Jacob Contest Display crops are wrong, how do I fix this?**
> Run the command `/shclearcontestdata` to clear the Jacob contest data.

> **8: How can I get bigger crop hit boxes?**
> Use [Patcher](<https://sk1er.club/mods/patcher>) to have 1.12 hitboxes in 1.8.9.

> **9: Why does my Item Tracker feature not track this item?**
> 1. Check if the item goes directly into your sacks. 
> 2. If it does, enable the sack pickup chat message from Hypixel:
>  - Go to `Hypixel Settings --> Personal -> Chat Feedback` and enable `Sack Notifications`.
> 3. If you want the [Sacks] messages to be hidden, do `/sh sacks hider` and enable that.

> **10: How do I remove SkyHanni GUI elements?**
