# How to install SkyHanni

- SkyHanni is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.8.9 only.
  Trying to run this on Badlion, Lunar, Feather, or newer versions of Minecraft is not supported.
  Follow this guide to install SkyHanni in regular Minecraft forge.

- If you already have mods, you can skip to step 4. Otherwise, start from step 1.
- If you already have the latest neu alpha, you can skip to step 5.

<details>
<summary>1. Run vanilla 1.8.9</summary>

Run Minecraft 1.8.9, unmodded, for 10 seconds, then close it.

</details>


<details>
<summary>2. Install Java.</summary>

In order to play with mods, you need Java.
Install [Java 8](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp).
Double click the file to install it.

</details>


<details>
<summary>3. Install Forge.</summary>

Forge is the system that loads your mods into the game.
You need Java to run forge.
Download [Forge for 1.8.9](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html).
Click installer, when you double click the file, install as client.
If forge does not open with Java, download [Jarfix](https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html),
double click it, then try running forge again.

<details>
<summary>4. Download NEU.</summary>

Neu is NotEnoughUpdates, another forge mod that contains files that SkyHanni depends on to function.
You can install it from [Moulberry's Bush Discord Server](https://discord.gg/moulberry) in the
channel [#🧪neu-alphas](https://discord.com/channels/516977525906341928/1028896920346841118) or
from [SkyHanni Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skyhanni-997079228510117908) in the
channel [#neu-updates](https://discord.com/channels/997079228510117908/1123201092193366027)

</details>


<details>
<summary>5. Download SkyHanni.</summary>

It is recommended to install the full version at first, since that has less bugs.
However, if you are a tech-savvy user and you want to test a potentially unstable version, install the beta.
If you experience any problems in the full release, try the beta.

</details>


<details>
<summary>6. Find .minecraft</summary>

Once you have downloaded both NEU and SkyHanni, you need to navigate to your .minecraft folder.
On Windows, open file explorer, in the file location bar at the top type in %appdata% and open .minecraft.
On Mac, go to ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft.

</details>


<details>
<summary>7. Open mods folder</summary>

If there is a "mods" folder, great! Open it.
Otherwise, create one and name it exactly "mods".

</details>


<details>
<summary>8. Move mods into mods folder</summary>

Move your neu and skyhanni .jar files into the folder.
Note: if you have a problem, people may ask to see your mod folder - that is this folder.

</details>


<details>
<summary>9. Setup ram</summary>

If you're running mods, you also need to setup your allocated ram.
If you don't know how much ram your computer has,
follow [this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/435644/how-to-see-how-much-ram-is-in-your-pc-and-its-speed/).
To allocate ram, go to installation, press the 3 dots next to the installation you are using,
click edit, press more options. In jvm arguments, look for something that says -Xmx2g or some other number
followed by g. That number is the amount you have allocated for Minecraft to use. If you have 2g of ram on your
computer, you might struggle to play Minecraft. Try to allocate 1g. If you have 4g, allocate 2g. If you
have 8 or more g, allocate 4g. You should never need more than 4g unless you have more mods than you know what to do
with.

</details>


<details>
<summary>10. Launch the forge profile in the launcher.</summary>

Installing Minecraft forge should have set the profile for you, but if it didn't, go to installations,
select new installation, under version you need to find forge for 1.8.9 (most likely at the top or bottom)

</details>


<details>
<summary>11. Recommended additional mods (optional)</summary>

[Optifine](https://optifine.net) and [Patcher](https://sk1er.club/mods/patcher)
(ask in the discord if you need help with those)
