_Frequently Asked Questions_

> **1: How do I open the SkyHanni Menu?**
> Use the command `/sh`

> **2: Why does SkyHanni tell me to update NotEnoughUpdates (NEU) even if I already have the latest version?**
> To make the mod work, you need to use the latest version from <#1123201092193366027>.

> **3: How can I resize the GUI?**
> Do `/sh gui` to open the position editor. Then hover over a element and scroll your mouse wheel to change the size of a single gui element.
> Do `/sh scale` to change the global gui scale of all elements at once.

> **4: My Garden Crop Milestones are not accurate. What should I do?**
> To sync your Crop Milestones with SkyHanni, open /cropmilestones once.

> **5: How can I move GUIs like Coins/Copper in SkyMart?**
> Use the command `/sh open hotkey` to set a hotkey, and press it inside the GUI you want to move.

> **6: Will SkyHanni support Minecraft versions 1.19 or 1.20? (Foraging Update)**
> The Foraging update isn't expected to release for several months.
> Thus, we'll wait for other mods in the community to update for Minecraft versions 1.19 or 1.20.
> Switching from 1.8.9 to 1.19 should only take a couple of days, and we plan to discontinue support for 1.8.9 afterward since we won't support multiple versions at once.

> **7: Does the barn fishing timer work on the Crimson Isle?**
> No, the barn fishing timer is not supported in the Crimson Isle in Hypixel Skyblock because it would disrupt other fishers due to competition for the maximum sea creature cap, potentially leading to conflicts and stealing of sea creatures.

> **8: My Jacob Contest Display crops are wrong, how do I fix this?**
> 1. Close your minecraft.
> 2. Delete ".minecraft\config\skyhanni\jacob_contests.json".
> 3. Open minecraft.

> **9: How do I add a custom background for the Scoreboard?**
> 1. Obtain a background image and name it "scoreboard.png".
> 2. Put the image into a texturepack, with the path ".minecraft\resourcepacks\<your texturepack>\assets\skyhanni\scoreboard.png".
> 3. Enable the texturepack in minecraft, then reload your game.
> 4. Do `/sh scoreboard background`, and toggle the Enable button.
