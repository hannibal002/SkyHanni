_Frequently Asked Questions_

> **1: How do I open the SkyHanni Menu?**
> Use the command `/sh`

> **2: Why does SkyHanni tell me to update NotEnoughUpdates (NEU) even if I already have the latest version?**
> To make the mod work, you need to use the latest version from <#1123201092193366027>.

> **3: How can I resize the GUI?**
> Do `/sh gui` to open the position editor. Then hover over a element and scroll your mouse wheel to change the size of a single gui element.
> Do `/sh scale` to change the global gui scale of all elements at once.

> **4: My Garden Crop Milestones are not accurate. What should I do?**
> To sync your Crop Milestones with SkyHanni, open /cropmilestones once.

> **5: How can I move GUIs like Coins/Copper in SkyMart?**
> Use the command `/sh open hotkey` to set a hotkey, and press it inside the GUI you want to move.

> **6: Will SkyHanni support Minecraft versions 1.19 or 1.20? (Foraging Update)**
> The Foraging update isn't expected to release for several months.
> Thus, we'll wait for other mods in the community to update for Minecraft versions 1.19 or 1.20.
> Switching from 1.8.9 to 1.19 should only take a couple of days, and we plan to discontinue support for 1.8.9 afterward since we won't support multiple versions at once.
