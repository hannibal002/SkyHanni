My little todo list for this

GUI:
Wrapping tooltip text to left when its near the right edge of screen
On all of the overview parts of the pages, show a progress bar that has a gradient representing the user's progress to maxing that aspect
Reposition stuff so it actually looks good
Add a border around the edge
- If not too hard, wrap it around the selected button as well
!!!!
Bugs: Tooltips don't work for any item or compact farming tooltips won't work
!!!!

Add:
Armor and its stats, hoverable item with mouse
Equiptment and its stats, hoverable item with mouse - updates on each visitor collection
Pets - Way to swap between Cow and Ele pet and it will dynamically change all the pet ff values to reflect that
If tool has bountiful wont't suggest blessed

Might remove the tool from displaying or just display it as a tooltip when you hover the item instead, as even with the compacted description it doesn't fit
