todo list for this display

more todo notes on WartsPage.kt

GUI:
Only show pets that are saved, and move the display around to fit how many are being displayed
Remove click to spawn/despawn from pets
Display pet item next to pet
Change colour of numbers and progress bars to reflect progress: red < 50%, orange < 65%, yellow < 80%, light green < 90% dark green > 90%
Warning when no item is selected, like an ! mark in the frame
Make the progress bars rounded
Layout some stuff a bit better
Wrapping tooltip text to left when its near the right edge of screen
On all of the overview parts of the pages, show a progress bar that has a gradient representing the user's progress to maxing that aspect
Reposition stuff so it actually looks good
Make the darken colour work
Add a border around the edge of the display
- If not too hard, wrap it around the selected button as well like neu - low priority
Check all turbo-crop enchants are named correctly
Full progress bars go over the edge on the right

!!!!
Buges:
Minor:
Shows unique tool as achieved all the time
Stop /ff from being used when not on skyblock
Taking off or putting equipment on inside the menu won't update it until you reopen the inventory
    - also if they sell the peice of equipment, it will always think they still have it
Will not detect pets that are not either mooshroom or elephant even if they have something like a bandana applied
Will overwrite the saved pet of each type if there is more than one of it in pets menu. e.g. uncommon ele will overwrite leg one
!!!!

Add:
Scrollable tooltips in the menu
Daedalus axe for mushroom and cocoa??
Way to switch pets that the menu is displayed for + won't prompt you to get the other pet
Work out when to save strength. Maybe when switching to tool
Save selected pet to config
Where it says tool reforge, say the ff for current rarity and the one above if it can be that
Can change pet on any page

Other:
Maybe remove unnecessary information in item tooltips eg:
    - enchant descriptions apart from cultivating, dedication and green thumb
    - ability descriptions like on the farming tools
