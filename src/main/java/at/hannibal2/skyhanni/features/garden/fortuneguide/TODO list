Remove the text saying dyed at the top of leather armor descriptions
Shorten the description on ranchers boots

Buges:
Major:
When opening the gui, uses elephant stats instead of selected pet
Tool reforge fortune even though no tool saved
Sometimes the ff breakdown for equipment and armor does not work in the gui?
    - fixes by holding shift over an item in the inventory then going back into the gui
If they sell their equipment or pets, they will be saved until a new one is bought and their stats counted : fix, don't liquidize your stuff lol
- can fix pets, equipment is more difficult
Minor:
Update strength when the command is run
Taking off or putting equipment on inside the menu won't update it until you reopen the inventory
    - also if they sell the piece of equipment, it will always think they still have it
!!!!

Add:
Daedalus axe for mushroom and cocoa??
Work out when to save strength.
Save selected pet to config
    - use the already saved one
