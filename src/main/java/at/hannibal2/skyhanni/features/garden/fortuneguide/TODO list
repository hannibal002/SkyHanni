todo list for this display

//todo check for crashes if selected an item when none is loaded

more todo notes on WartsPage.kt

Work out how to access the data, load it all when the gui is opened then access through a single method as it won't change while gui is open
Use items list for tools instead of loading on individual pages

Deal with pets
Deal with mushroom cow and strength

Render an item like a barrier, with lore saying that you don't have it
Change lore on equipment to reflect visitors served
Track pet level ups
Message if stat hasn't been checked yet
Click commands for things they are missing
-> farming level -> /skills etc.



GUI:
Only show pets that are saved, and move the display around to fit how many are being displayed
Remove click to spawn/despawn from pets
Display pet item somewhere
Layout some stuff a bit better
Wrapping tooltip text to left when its near the right edge of screen
Reposition stuff so it actually looks good
Make the darken colour work
Add a border around the edge of the display
- If not too hard, wrap it around the selected button as well like neu - low priority
Check all turbo-crop enchants are named correctly
Change colour of percentage text to reflect completed percentage

!!!!
Buges:
Major:
Will overwrite the saved pet of each type if there is more than one of it in pets menu. e.g. uncommon ele will overwrite leg one
Minor:
Cakes will not appear as missing until they are eaten once so the mod knows when it runs out
Shows unique tool stat as achieved all the time
Taking off or putting equipment on inside the menu won't update it until you reopen the inventory
    - also if they sell the peice of equipment, it will always think they still have it
!!!!

Add:
Scrollable tooltips in the menu
Daedalus axe for mushroom and cocoa??
Way to switch pets that the menu is displayed for + won't prompt you to get the other pet
Work out when to save strength. Maybe when switching to tool
Save selected pet to config
Where it says tool reforge, say the ff for current rarity and the one above if it can be that

Other:
Maybe remove unnecessary information in item tooltips eg:
    - enchant descriptions apart from cultivating, dedication and green thumb
    - ability descriptions like on the farming tools

Purchasing a garden plot sends you back to that menu so it should count that new plot, but I cannot test it
