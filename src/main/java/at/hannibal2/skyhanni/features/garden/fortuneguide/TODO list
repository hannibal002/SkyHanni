GUI:
Only show pets that are saved, and move the display around to fit how many are being displayed
Remove click to spawn/despawn from pets
Display pet item somewhere
Layout some stuff a bit better
Wrapping tooltip text to left when its near the right edge of screen
Reposition stuff so it actually looks good
Make the darken colour work
Add a border around the edge of the display
- If not too hard, wrap it around the selected button as well like neu - low priority
Check all turbo-crop enchants are named correctly
Change colour of percentage text to reflect completed percentage

Buges:
Major:
Crash if fortune is more than max for slider or less than 0
Will overwrite the saved pet of each type if there is more than one of it in pets menu. e.g. uncommon ele will overwrite leg one
If they sell their equipment or pets, they will be saved until a new one is bought and their stats counted : fix, don't liquidize your stuff lol
- can fix pets, equipment is more difficult
Minor:
If you change tool but don't swap to it since you changed it, these won't be updated
Cakes will not appear as missing until they are eaten once so the mod knows when it runs out
Shows unique tool stat as achieved all the time
Taking off or putting equipment on inside the menu won't update it until you reopen the inventory
    - also if they sell the piece of equipment, it will always think they still have it
!!!!

Add:
Scrollable tooltips in the menu
Daedalus axe for mushroom and cocoa??
Way to switch pets that the menu is displayed for + won't prompt you to get the other pet
Work out when to save strength. Maybe when switching to tool
Save selected pet to config
Where it says tool reforge, say the ff for current rarity and the one above if it can be that

Other:
Maybe remove unnecessary information in item tooltips eg:
    - enchant descriptions apart from cultivating, dedication and green thumb
    - ability descriptions like on the farming tools

Purchasing a garden plot sends you back to that menu so it should count that new plot, but I cannot test it
