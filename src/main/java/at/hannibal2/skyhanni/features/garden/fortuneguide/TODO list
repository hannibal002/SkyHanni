GUI:
Only show pets that are saved, and move the display around to fit how many are being displayed
Wrapping tooltip text to left when its near the right edge of screen
Custom tooltips, like NEU to change the colours around it maybe
Add a border around the edge of the display
- If not too hard, wrap it around the selected button as well like neu - low priority
Remove the text saying dyed at the top of leather armor descriptions
Shorten the description on ranchers boots

!!!!
Buges:
Major:
Sometimes the ff breakdown for equipment and armor does not work in the gui?
Does not count plots correctly, works sometimes not others
Will overwrite the saved pet of each type if there is more than one of it in pets menu. e.g. uncommon ele will overwrite leg one
If they sell their equipment or pets, they will be saved until a new one is bought and their stats counted : fix, don't liquidize your stuff lol
- can fix pets, equipment is more difficult
Minor:
Boots speed display is not working in /ff idk if i want it there though
Update strength when the command is run
Taking off or putting equipment on inside the menu won't update it until you reopen the inventory
    - also if they sell the piece of equipment, it will always think they still have it
!!!!

Add:
Daedalus axe for mushroom and cocoa??
Way to switch pets that the menu is displayed for + won't prompt you to get the other pet
Work out when to save strength.
Save selected pet to config
    - use the already saved one
Where it says tool reforge, say the ff for current rarity and the one above if it can be that

Other:
Remove unnecessary information in item tooltips eg:
    - enchant descriptions apart from cultivating, dedication and green thumb
    - ability descriptions like on the farming tools
