!!!!
Buges:
Major:
Sometimes the ff breakdown for equipment and armor does not work in the gui?
    - fixes by holding shift over an item in the inventory then going back into the gui
If they sell their equipment or pets, they will be saved until a new one is bought and their stats counted : fix, don't liquidize your stuff lol
- can fix pets, equipment is more difficult
Minor:
Taking off or putting equipment on inside the menu won't update it until you reopen the inventory
    - also if they sell the piece of equipment, it will always think they still have it
!!!!

Add:
Daedalus axe for mushroom
