# How to Contribute

This tutorial explains how to set up a development environment to work on SkyHanni. We use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as an example.

## Basics
SkyHanni is a 1.8.9 Forge mod, written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Java](https://www.java.com/en/).
We use a [gradle config](https://gradle.org/) to build the mod, 
written in [Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html).

This development environment uses [DevAuth](https://github.com/DJtheRedstoner/DevAuth) to allow connecting to Hypixel while debugging in IntelliJ.

## Setup

### Download IntelliJ
- Download IntelliJ from [JetBrains Website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- Use Community Edition.
